It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has **a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,** as opposed to using &#8216;Content here, content here&#8217;, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for &#8216;lorem ipsum&#8217; will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
